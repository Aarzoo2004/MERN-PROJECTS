# MERN Stack Projects

This repository contains **practice projects built using the MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Each project has its own folder with a dedicated README explaining its features, setup instructions, and usage.

These projects are created for learning and improving full-stack development skills.
